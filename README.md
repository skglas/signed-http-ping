Simple, HTTP-based Client Server Monitoring with rotating values

Your Situation:
-You need to monitor the availability of a system.
-You want a bit more than a predictable string

Assumptions:
-Monitoring Client and Server return identical System Times
-Ports/Networking are available

How it works:
-The Client computes a Hash values out of the current time/minute and a shared secret in a loop
-Every minute, the Client sends such a new value as http get request to the Server.
-The Server pre-computes a window of 10 hashes using the same time and the same shared secret
-When a Client with a valid hash request is received from the server, the hash is removed from the list
-Every five minutes, the server checks the list of remaining hashes. If not enough hashes were received /removed (monitoring failed), an e-Mail is sent to notify that there are gaps in the monitoring.
